1. Sort states.txt alphabetically and save it as a new file named states-sorted.txt
1. In states.txt, replace all occurrences of the letter `a` with the letter `z` and save it as a new file named stztes.txt
1. Edit `~/.bash_profile` and create an alias for the command `ls -alt` that equals `l`

    **DO NOT use the source command to reload your console.** You can use the `refresh` to reload your console and verify your alias is working.

1. Type `history > history.txt` this will create a file called history.txt that contains all of the commands you entered to accomplish these tasks.
